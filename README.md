My repo for source code and report for CE4042 assignment 2 2020-2021 semester 1.

This is the second personal coding project required for grading in this Covid-19 semester. The scope of the assigment is on CNNs and RNNs. Similar to the first assignment, students are expected to investigate the change of various hyperparameters on the training results.
